# URQtToolbox
Universal Robot Toolbox for MATLAB leveraging Qt 

## Current Limitations
1. This toolbox is currently under development for the UR3e with a connected Robotiq Hand-E gripper. While the URQt class **should** work with commands to other UR models and other Robotiq grippers, the class has yet to be tested with other model combinations.
